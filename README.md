## Features and Functionality
### Log In/Sign Up
Users can sign up or log in to gain access to logged in features. If a user wishes not to create an account, they may choose to use the Demo Login feature. A modal will pop up when the 'Get Started' or 'Log In' buttons are clicked.

The modal has an optional redirect link to direct you from the 'Sign Up' to 'Log In'. The modal can then be closed if the proper credentials are entered, the 'x' in the corner, or by clicking outside of the modal.
